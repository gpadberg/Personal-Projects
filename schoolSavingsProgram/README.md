# School Savings Program

## Overview

This Python script is designed to help students plan for their education by projecting their savings over time and comparing it with the projected costs of different programs. The program takes user inputs for interest rates, monthly contributions, and initial lump sum, and then calculates the savings over 18 years. It also calculates the projected tuition costs for arts, science, and engineering programs over the same period.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib library (install using `pip install matplotlib`)

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python schoolSavings.py`
2. Enter the required information when prompted (interest rate, monthly contribution, initial lump sum).
3. The script will display the savings amount and projected costs of arts, science, and engineering programs over 18 years.
4. A plot will be generated comparing the savings balance with the tuition costs. The plot will be displayed in a separate window.

## File Structure

- `schoolSavings.py`: The main Python script.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the script and instructions for use.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the Matplotlib library is installed before running the script.
- If running in a terminal, make sure to check for a separate window displaying the plot.
- For any issues or questions, feel free to contact the author.
