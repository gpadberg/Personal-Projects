# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Python project! Engage in the timeless battle of Xs and Os, strategically placing your marks on the grid to achieve victory.

## Description

This program allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against another player or challenge the computer to a game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.

## Usage

1. Run the script: `python tictactoe.py`
2. Choose whether you want to play against another human or challenge the computer.
3. Enter your moves using the numbered grid as reference.
4. The game will declare the winner or announce a tie when the board is full.

## Project Structure

- The `tictactoe.py` script contains the main game logic.
- The `HumanPlayer` class represents a human player.
- The `RandomComputerPlayer` class models the computer's moves (currently incomplete).

## Note

**Project Status:** The computer's intelligence is a work in progress. It currently makes random moves and does not provide a challenging opponent. Future updates may include a more advanced computer player.

## Acknowledgment

This project was created alongside a tutorial on YouTube by Kylie Ying. Check out the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg) to learn how to build your own Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## Contribution

Contributions to improve the computer player's intelligence or add new features are welcome! If you have ideas to enhance the Tic Tac Toe experience, create a pull request and contribute to the project.

Let the strategic battles begin, and may the best strategist emerge victorious!
