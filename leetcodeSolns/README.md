# LeetCode Python Solutions

Welcome to the LeetCode Python Solutions repository! This collection contains various Python solutions to LeetCode problems. Please note that these solutions are intended to run in the LeetCode testing environment rather than a local terminal or text editor.

## Usage

1. **LeetCode Platform:**
   - Copy the provided Python code for the specific problem.
   - Visit the [LeetCode website](https://leetcode.com/) and navigate to the problem you want to solve.
   - Paste the code into the LeetCode editor.
   - Test your solution by running the LeetCode test cases.

2. **Local Testing:**
   - While these solutions are designed for LeetCode, you can also test them locally.
   - Copy the code into a Python environment or script.
   - Adapt the code as needed for local testing, providing input manually.

## Project Structure

- Each Python script corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem.
- The file name indicates the problem's ID and a brief description.
- Open the file to view the Python solution for that problem.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute additional LeetCode solutions or improvements to existing ones. If you come up with a more efficient solution or want to add explanations, create a pull request, and let's learn together!

Happy coding and happy problem-solving on LeetCode!
