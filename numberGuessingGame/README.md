# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game Python project! This game offers two exciting modes: one where you guess a number, and the other where the computer takes its chances at guessing your number.

## Guess the Number (You vs. Computer)

**Description:** Challenge yourself by guessing a random number chosen by the computer. Practice your input validation and conditional statement skills.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script: `python numberguessinggame.py`
2. Enter an upper bound for the random number range.
3. Start guessing until you get it right!

## Computer Guesses Your Number

**Description:** Let the computer flex its algorithms by attempting to guess the number you're thinking of. Provide feedback after each guess, and witness the computer's deductive prowess.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script: `python numberguessinggame.py`
2. Enter an upper bound for the random number range.
3. Let the computer make its guesses based on your feedback.

## Project Structure

- The `numberguessinggame.py` script contains both game modes.
- The `HumanPlayer` class represents the user when guessing.
- The `RandomComputerPlayer` class models the computer's guessing strategy.
